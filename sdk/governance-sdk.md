# Governance SDK

The Governance SDK is a protocol and blockchain agnostic governance interoperability framework built for NodeJS and the browser. It makes it easier for developers to query and interact with protocol governance in a normalized way by leveraging community-authored protocol integrations.

Both the [Boardroom API](../boardroom-api/boardroom-api.md) and the [Boardroom Portal](https://app.boardroom.info) use the Governance SDK directly.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are wanting to build applications or experiences on top of read-only or aggegated governance data, or are not building for a NodeJS or browser environment, check out the [Boardroom API](../boardroom-api/boardroom-api.md) for integrating data sourced by the Governance SDK.
