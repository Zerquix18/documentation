# 3. Claim Your Space

The final step to get your project integrated into Boardroom is to claim your space.

As anyone can create a space on snapshot, we have added a claiming step as a liveness check to make sure we do not have any zombie projects in the portal. 

The process to claim your space is simple.

**Step 1:** Find your space in the Boardroom Hub front page. For example:

**Step 2:** Click the claim button

**Step 3a:** If you are a member of the snapshot space, you will be prompted to fill out some basic information, as well as a more detailed overview of your team's governance process. 

**Step 3b.** If you are not a member, you will be prompted to reach out to a snapshot space member to come claim the space.

**Step 4.** After you have filled out the details, and signed the message, your claim will be vetted and, if approved, your space will be unlocked within 24-36 hours.

**N.B.** As a preliminary check for liveness, only snapshot spaces with at least 3 members are made available to claim on Boardroom.
