## The Boardroom Project Information Repository 

To get started on Boardroom, visit our Project Information Repository page on Github: [https://github.com/boardroom-inc/protocol-Info](https://github.com/boardroom-inc/protocol-Info).

This public repository is where all the information that one sees in the Boardroom governance portal is uploaded, stored, and maintained. 

If you're a person or team that wants to add a project to Boardroom and/or update information for an existing project, you can do so by: 

1. Creating a new branch
2. Making and committing changes
3. Submitting a pull request

The Boardroom team will then review your pull request and merge if... \(INSERT\)
