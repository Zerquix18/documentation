# Governance SDK

The Governance SDK is a protocol and blockchain agnostic governance interoperability framework. It makes it easier for developers to query and interact with protocol governance in a normalized way by leveraging community-authored protocol integrations.

We believe that as crypto governance continues to grow in complexity, the need for an open, community-driven integration SDK can increase accessibility to governance participation and allow for powerful emergent governance interactions and experiences.
