# Introduction

## What is the Boardroom SDK?

The @boardroom-sdk is a collection of governance protocols. All read & write operations can be invoked through a GraphQL or Typescript interface. Each protocol extends from a common interface, allowing app developers to easily consume all governance protocols in aggregate.

## What can it do?

It can perform read operations that allow the consumer to get data from different governance protocols, either separately or in aggregate. The data provided by the SDK is sanitized at runtime and type-safe, ensuring data integrity for its users.
