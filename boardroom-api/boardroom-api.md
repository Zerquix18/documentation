# Boardroom API

We believe that free and open access to aggregated governance data is a crucial tool in navigating the rapidly growing ecosystem of stakeholder owned crypto networks. The Boardroom API is a centralized HTTP API that uses the open-source [Governance SDK](../sdk/governance-sdk.md) to continually index and aggregate governance data across all integrated protocols at scale.

{% hint style="success" %}
We are working finalizing our interoperability layer powered by the Governance SDK before making our HTTP API publicly available. If you are looking to integrate governance data into your application, get in touch with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UBqtEddhsC), we'd love to hear your ideas and talk about what we have in store üöÄ

TUSD is the only stablecoin that has [real-time, 24/7 attestations](https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/trusttoken) from Armanino, a top US accounting firm, providing assurance that the token is fully collateralized by US Dollars. \n \n## Market Parameters \nThis proposal sets TUSD with a collateral factor of 0%, reserve factor of 7.5%, and unlimited borrow cap. These parameters follow the values set by USDT, with 0% collateral factor. The collateral factor can be proposed to be higher with a future proposal. \n \n This proposal updates the Compound price feed to peg TUSD to $1, similarly to USDC. By using a peg, weakness in the underlying asset will not change collateral requirements for users borrowing TUSD.\n \n[The interest rate model](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb564da37b41b2f6b6edcc3e56fbf523bd9f2012) for TrueUSD relies on the same model as cUSDT and cDAI, JumpRateModelV2. \n \n## Contracts \ncTUSD is an upgradeable cToken contract that has been modified to accommodate potential transfer fees in the underlying token. \n \nThe cToken contract has been reviewed by OpenZeppelin and the Compound team. The cTUSD contract has been reviewed by the TrustToken and Ethworks teams. \n \nThe case for why TUSD benefits compound has been discussed by the [compound community here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/trueusd-listing-proposal-stay-tuned/1490)",

This proposal transfers Compound governance to the new Governor Bravo contract. If this proposal is successful, all future Compound governance calls should be sent to [Governor Bravo](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc0da02939e1441f497fd74f78ce7decb17b66529).\n\n### Proposal Calls\nThe first two calls reimburse Compound Labs $27k that was paid to Open Zeppelin for the audit from the cUSDC reserves. The following two calls award COMP bounties to Arr00 and Blurr for organizing and executing the Governor Bravo project. The following call sets Governor Bravo as the pending admin, and the last call initiates Governor Bravo, accepting the Timelock admin.\n\n### Governor Bravo Details:\nGovernor Bravo has been developed by members of the community in the open for the past few months. The new contracts have been fully audited by Open Zeppelin, are fully covered by extensive test suites, have been simulated by forking simulations, and have been running on the kovan testnet. \n\nThe new features are as follows:\n- Upgradable implementation \n- Settable parameters (proposal threshold, voting period, voting delay)\n- Abstain vote option\n- Optional string voting reason\n- Proposer can always cancel their proposal (until execution)\n- Removal of the guardian\n- Continuous proposal id logic\n\n#### PS:\nTo celebrate the alphas who voted on Governor Alpha, we will be releasing a limited edition Compound NFT claimable by anyone who voted meaningfully on Governor Alpha prior to this proposal once Governor Bravo is initiated.\n\n#### References:\nDevelopment forum [post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/governor-bravo-development/942)\nProposal forum [post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/governor-bravo-proposal/1384)\n[Github PR](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/91)\n[Open Zeppelin Audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-governor-bravo-audit/)",

    "content": "LINK is a widely distributed token, with significant liquidity both on and off-chain. As a new market, it will be introduced with the following conservative market parameters: \n - Collateral Factor: 0%\n - Reserve Factor: 25%\n - COMP Speed: 0.0014625 (also set for UNI, BAT, ZRX)\n - Interest Rate Model (JumpRateModelV2)\n - 2% APY borrow base rate\n - 20% APY borrow rate at kink\n - Kink at 80% utilization\n - 100% APY borrow rate at 100% utilization\n\nA 0% collateral factor provides a ‚Äúno risk‚Äù approach to adding the new asset, and allows the protocol to test if the interest rate model and other parameters are a proper fit. Once the market develops there can be an immediate follow-up proposal to increase the collateral factor based on market performance, stress tests etc.\n\nThe Reserve Factor, COMP Speed, and Interest Rate Models were chosen based off the parameters for similar assets (UNI, ZRX, and BAT)\n\n#### Oracle\nThe current oracle and TUSD proposal's new oracle is compatible with LINK there is no change needed.\n\n#### cLINK Contract\nThe cLINK contract is based on the most recently deployed cToken (cWBTC2) implementation, which includes a sweepToken enhancement for governance to collect accidentally sent tokens received by the proxy contract.\n\n#### Special Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks goes out to MasterofNonce for writing the CAP description; Arr00 for helping write simulations; mistertom, jmo, blck, and rleshner for helping decide the parameter proposals; and the community in general for the support and TRiLeZ to organize and deploy the necessery contract and the whole proposal.\n\n#### References\n - [cLINK contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xface851a4921ce59e912d19329929ce6da6eb0c7#code)\n - [Forums discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-market-link/1516)\n - [Integration scenario](https://github.com/TRiLeZ/compound-protocol/blob/clink-integration/spec/sim/0010-clink-integration/hypothetical_clink_integration.scen)\n - [Updated mainnet.json](https://github.com/TRiLeZ/compound-protocol/blob/clink-integration/networks/mainnet.json)\n - [Updated token deploy script used](https://github.com/TRiLeZ/compound-protocol/blob/update-deploy-token/script/saddle/deployToken.js)",
