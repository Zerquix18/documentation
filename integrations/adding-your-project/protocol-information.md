# Protocol Information

### The Project Information Repository 

All project addition and edits occur on the public [Project Information repository on Github](https://github.com/boardroom-inc/protocol-Info), where all information seen in the Boardroom governance portal is uploaded, stored, and maintained. These docs will walk you through how to add the necessary project information to this repository in a few simple steps, to get your project added to the Boardroom Portal frontend. 

If you're a person or team that wants to add a project to Boardroom and/or update information for an existing project, you can do so by: 

1. Creating a new branch
2. Making and committing changes
3. Submitting a pull request

The Boardroom team will then review your pull request and merge if... \(INSERT\)
