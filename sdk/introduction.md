# Introduction

The Governance SDK is a protocol and blockchain agnostic governance aggregation framework. It makes it easier for developers to to integrate governance experiences into client applications by leveraging community-authored protocol integrations.

We believe that as crypto governance continues to grow in complexity, the need for an open, community-driven integration SDK can increase accessibility to governance participation and allow for powerful emergent governance interactions and experiences.
