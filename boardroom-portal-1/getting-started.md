# Boardroom Portal

From policy ideation to execution, the **Boardroom Portal** helps communities and digital organizations make informed decisions by combining three core features:

1. **Ideation:** Built on [**Ceramic**](https://ceramic.network/), the Ideation features provides an elegant solution to prioritize discussions and ideas in a decentralized, censorship-resistant way.
2. **Voting:** Voting tools that leverage existing governance and composable frameworks allow teams to customize processes based on their goals
3. **Treasury:** Powered by [**Multisafe**](https://multisafe.finance/), the treasury tab encourages transparency by displaying real-time balance, flows, and transaction information
