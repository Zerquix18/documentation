## Rarible DAO <a id="e64b"></a>

Our ultimate goal is to evolve towards a Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\), where all decision rights will belong to the platform users.

RARI token, awarded to the active users of the platform, will act as the governance instrument: it will enable collectors and creators to vote on multiple upgrades and decide how the platform should develop further. This makes the governance of the platform directly responsive to our most active users and brings Rarible closer to being a public good operated by the community members who value it most.

## RARI Token Holder Rights <a id="8df5"></a>

### I. Voting on system upgrades <a id="6456"></a>

The key part of token holder rights is to have influence over the platform development. If community wants it — everything is possible.

1. Holders of RARI can submit and vote on proposals about:

   1. Rarible’s trading fees
   2. New Rarible features to be developed or implemented by our team
   3. The use of RARI to further decentralize the governance and development of Rarible

2. In the initial exploratory period for RARI, most votes will initially be “advisory votes”. These are votes which will provide us signals of users’ desires for Rarible that, in most cases, we anticipate abiding by, but are technically non-binding. Such non-binding votes are a common tool in traditional corporate governance — for example, public companies may hold “say on pay” votes which gather community sentiment on executive officer salaries. However, over time we will work with the community of RARI holders to create a more formal governance structure where more votes can be binding and trustlessly implemented. RARI does not confer any legal rights to manage the Rarible business or to receive profits from Rarible — in its initial version, RARI confers the right of active customers of Rarible to participate in each advisory voting process announced on [Rarible.com](http://rarible.com/).

### II. Moderating creators on the platform <a id="1f7b"></a>

Establishing community-based moderation is a challenging task. We are considering implementing a system analogous to Aragon Court or entering a partnership to solve it.

### III. Curating featured artworks <a id="b566"></a>

Hot or not? Community decides who deserves an extra boost.
