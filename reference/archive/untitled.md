# Getting Started

## Contributor Program

## What is Github?

Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.

If you're new to Github, check out these useful guides:

* [https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github)

## Creating a Github Account

To contribute to the Boardroom protocol -info repository on Github, you'll need to first make an account: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

Once a project is added to Boardroom, teams can add and update the information displayed on their project's page in the governance portal.

Including:

* **Content Folders** - Add content to the Resources tab 
* **Files** - 
* **Calendar Events** - Populate the Calendar tab with events, governance calls, upcoming votes, and more. 
* **Weekly Updates** - Summarize what members need to know about governance each week. These updates are housed in the Resources tab in the portal and included in Boardroom's weekly Rock the Vote newsletter on [Boardroom Insights](https://governance.substack.com/), our Substack. 

### Want to Contribute?

We pay weekly contributors to the protocol information repo $25 in DAI each week. Reach out to Kevin Nielsen or Tyler Whirty on the Boardroom Discord to learn more.

## Structure
