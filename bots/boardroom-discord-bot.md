# Boardroom Discord Bot

The **Boardroom Discord Bot** uses the [Boardroom API ](../boardroom-api/boardroom-api.md)to bring governance data right into your Discord server. This allows members of your server to request governance information and be notified of any changes. This includes:

* Displaying Boardroom's supported protocols
* Displaying the proposals in a particular protocol
* Displaying the details of a particular proposal
* Checking the voters for a protocol proposal
* Checking the proposals a particular voter has participated in
* Displaying global statistics

You can also subscribe to this information and be notified when it changes.
